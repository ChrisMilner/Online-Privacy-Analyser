The first machine that resembled a computer was designed by Charles Babbage also born in London, England. The first programmable computer was invented by a German named Konrad Zuse and the concept for the modern computer (the Turing Machine) was created by the English Alan Turing. The US did have a large part in the commercialisation of computers (through IBM) however, they had very little to do with its invention.\n* Kyle was correct about the monitor as it was invented by Allen B DuMont born in New York.\n* He was also correct about the invention of the Keyboard as it is mainly accredited to the American Christopher Latham Sholes and another man named Matthew Roper who I could not find a nationality for.\n\nAfter looking through the facts I can only come to one conclusion :\n\nFuck Kyle\n\nEDIT: I'm not American (I'm English) and this wasn't meant to be an America is better than everyone post, I just wanted to correct some of the things Kyle said."}],"confidence":1,"name":"Keyword Posted","value":"fuck"},{"sources":[{"name":"First Name","source":{"name":"Facebook Account","source":{},"value":"100008177116719"},"value":"Chris"},{"name":"First Name","source":{"name":"Name","source":{"name":"Twitter Account","source":{},"value":"chrisdmilner"},"value":"ChrisDMilner"},"value":"Chris"},{"name":"First Name","source":{"name":"Name","source":{"name":"Twitter Account","source":{},"value":"chrisdmilner"},"value":"Chris M"},"value":"Chris"},{"name":"First Name","source":{"name":"Name","source":{"name":"Facebook Account","source":{},"value":"100008177116719"},"value":"Chris Milner"},"value":"Chris"}],"confidence":0.908,"name":"First Name","value":"Chris"},{"sources":[{"name":"Middle Name","source":{"name":"Name","source":{"name":"Twitter Account","source":{},"value":"chrisdmilner"},"value":"ChrisDMilner"},"value":"D"}],"confidence":0.977,"name":"Middle Name","value":"D"},{"sources":[{"name":"Last Name","source":{"name":"Facebook Account","source":{},"value":"100008177116719"},"value":"Milner"},{"name":"Last Name","source":{"name":"Name","source":{"name":"Twitter Account","source":{},"value":"chrisdmilner"},"value":"ChrisDMilner"},"value":"Milner"},{"name":"Last Name","source":{"name":"Name","source":{"name":"Facebook Account","source":{},"value":"100008177116719"},"value":"Chris Milner"},"value":"Milner"},{"name":"Last Name","source":{"name":"Name","source":{"name":"Twitter Account","source":{},"value":"chrisdmilner"},"value":"Chris M"},"value":"M"}],"confidence":0.908,"name":"Last Name","value":"Milner"},{"sources":[{"name":"Max Birth Date","source":{"name":"Min Age","source":{"name":"Facebook Account","source":{},"value":"100008177116719"},"value":"18"},"value":"Fri Mar 10 20:39:36 GMT 2000"},{"name":"Min Birth Date","source":{"name":"Max Age","source":{"name":"Facebook Account","source":{},"value":"100008177116719"},"value":"20"},"value":"Mon Mar 10 20:39:36 GMT 1997"}],"confidence":0.9888,"name":"Birth Year","value":"1997 - 2000"},{"sources":[{"name":"Max Birth Date","source":{"name":"Min Age","source":{"name":"Facebook Account","source":{},"value":"100008177116719"},"value":"18"},"value":"Fri Mar 10 20:39:36 GMT 2000"},{"name":"Min Birth Date","source":{"name":"Max Age","source":{"name":"Facebook Account","source":{},"value":"100008177116719"},"value":"20"},"value":"Mon Mar 10 20:39:36 GMT 1997"}],"confidence":0.9888,"name":"Age","value":"18 - 21"},{"sources":[{"name":"Location","source":{"name":"Twitter Account","source":{},"value":"chrisdmilner"},"value":"England"}],"confidence":0.977,"name":"Location","value":"England"},{"sources":[{"name":"Image URL","source":{"name":"Twitter Account","source":{},"value":"chrisdmilner"},"value":"http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/472689571868598273/sD45ycFC.jpeg"}],"confidence":0.977,"name":"Image URL","value":"http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/472689571868598273/sD45ycFC.jpeg"},{"sources":[{"name":"Image URL","source":{"name":"Facebook Account","source":{},"value":"100008177116719"},"value":"https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/p200x200/11228900_1643269115955643_4776790527226754188_n.jpg?oh=76b7f04be3ed852486cf79ddfd772173&oe=5B394238"}],"confidence":0.9944,"name":"Image URL","value":"https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/p200x200/11228900_1643269115955643_4776790527226754188_n.jpg?oh=76b7f04be3ed852486cf79ddfd772173&oe=5B394238"},{"sources":[{"name":"Image URL","source":{"name":"Facebook Account","source":{},"value":"100008177116719"},"value":"https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/s720x720/11022619_1584884048460817_6287139976782863985_o.jpg?oh=8c2f0ca4e2de544e5145f5794304a26b&oe=5B354E71"}],"confidence":0.9944,"name":"Image URL","value":"https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/s720x720/11022619_1584884048460817_6287139976782863985_o.jpg?oh=8c2f0ca4e2de544e5145f5794304a26b&oe=5B354E71"}]}
