    <h1 id="title">Our Privacy Policy</h1>

    <div class="privacy-section">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>We take privacy very seriously. In fact that is why this system was created, as a means to show you how much, potentially private, data you might be sharing online. As such we have written this privacy policy that you see here which defines how we use your data. This project is also mostly open-source meaning if you have any concerns about what we are doing with your data you can see all of the code <a href="https://github.com/RadioactiveMonkey/Online-Privacy-Analyser">here</a>.</p>

    <div class="privacy-section">
        <h2>What Information do we Process?</h2>
        <p>The system takes in three sources of information at a maximum. A Twitter URL, a Reddit URL and a Facebook URL (or Facebook Login access token). From these sources the system only accesses data publicly available about you, or in the case of Facebook Login the information you choose to share with us. This public data may then be used to perform secondary searches for your information (similar to a Google search). However, again the information will be exclusively taken from public sources.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="privacy-section">
        <h2>What Information do we Store?</h2>
        <p>The system does not store any of your information for any longer than the processing takes. As soon as the systems conclusions are displayed back to you, your data is deleted.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="privacy-section">
        <h2>Who do we share your information with?</h2>
        <p>We do not share your information with anyone. None of your data is stored for any longer than necessary.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="privacy-section">
        <h2>How do I find out if this policy changes?</h2>
        <p>In the unlikely event of a policy update, the update will be posted here and changes will be highlighted at the top of the page. Since we don't store any of your data we cannot contact you to inform you.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="privacy-section">
        <h2>How do I get in contact with you with any concerns?</h2>
        <p>If you have any concerns about this project and how we use your date you can email: christophermilner@btinternet.com</p>
